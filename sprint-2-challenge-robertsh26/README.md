# Sprint 2 Challenge

## Overview
Welcome to the Sprint 2 Challenge! You will be completing a list of coding challenges by writing code in the `index.html` file. Each coding challenge has a set of tests that must pass in order to receive a passing grade. 

Below you will find step-by-step instructions to help you get setup and complete this Sprint Challenge. Good luck!

## 1. Setup Instructions

### Cloning the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine. Cloning creates a local copy of the project on your computer. To clone your repository, open your terminal or Git BASH and execute: 

```
git clone [your-repo-url-here]
```

You can get your repo url from GitHub by clicking on the green "<> Code" button and clicking on the copy button for the url.

### Preparing Your Environment
Once you have your files on your machine, open the `index.html` file in two programs:
  - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for editing.
  - [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for viewing your changes.
 In Chrome, access the Dev Tools by either right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" or Ctrl+Shift+I/Cmd+Option+I. Then navigate to the Console tab. This is where you will see the results of the tests.

## 2. Challenge Completion

### Working Through Challenges
For each challenge, read the instructions within the challenge link below and write your code in the `index.html` file. The `index.html` file has a function labeled with the challenge number where you will write your code. 
- **Challenges List:**
  - [Challenge 1](./challenges/Challenge_1.md)
  - [Challenge 2](./challenges/Challenge_2.md)
  - [Challenge 3](./challenges/Challenge_3.md)
  - [Challenge 4](./challenges/Challenge_4.md)
  - [Challenge 5 (optional)](./challenges/Challenge_5.md)
  - [Challenge 6 (optional)](./challenges/Challenge_6.md)

### Testing Your Code
To see if your code is passing the tests, open the `index.html` file in Chrome and look at the console. You will see a green checkbox for each test you pass and a red X for any tests that did not pass.

You must pass all the tests for each challenge to receive a passing grade.

## 3. Submission Process

### Connecting to CodeGrade
Follow the instructions on Canvas to connect your project with CodeGrade. Once connected, you can submit your code by pushing your code to your GitHub repo.

### Pushing Code to GitHub
Use the following git commands to push your completed challenge to GitHub for automatic grading:
```
git add .
git commit -m 'Challenge Submission'
git push
```

At any point of the Sprint Challenge, you can submit your code to CodeGrade and you can make an unlimited number of submissions.
